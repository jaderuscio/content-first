<section class="fontinfo" id="about">Georgia is a Transitional serif typeface designed by
Matthew Carter and released in 1996 through Microsoft. Since Georgia is
a web safe system font, it has been one of the primary serifs, along
with Times New Roman, used on the web since the late 1990s. In 2011, a
pro version of Georgia was released that includes additional weights
and condensed versions. I think Georgia makes an excellent font for
reading long passages of text on screens.</section>
